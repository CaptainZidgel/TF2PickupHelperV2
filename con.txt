connect.lua is a file in the Lumble folder containing these parameters

conn.key = str path to key from Lumble folder
conn.pem = str path to pem/certificate from Lumble folder
conn.ip = str hostname/ip to connect to
conn.port = number port

conn.motd = str message of the day
conn.motd_enabled = bool
conn.draftlock_enabled = bool (whether draftlock should be enforced, NOT whether the draft is currently locked)
conn.prison_enabled = bool (whether users who volunteer as medic should be forced into their channels)

conn.pugroot_path = str path from root channel to where pugs are rooted in (the channel Add Up and pug servers are in, etc)
conn.spacebase_path = str path from root channel to where the bot sits
conn.addup_path = str path from pugroot channel to channel where users add up
conn.chill_path = str path from root channel to channel where users can sit when they're not playing
conn.server_pattern = str lua pattern for describing the format of Pug server channel names (i.e. "Pug %d", "Pug Server %d")

Please note NONE of these values have defaults except bools default to false, and the bot will not work if you do not set up the string variables.

You may format it like this: (Why am I explaining this, you know how Lua works.)

```file begin
return {
	key = ...,
	pem = ...,
	...,etc
}
```file end
